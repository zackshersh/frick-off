# Unit 7: Project 1 
The Little A**hole       
#Group 3: Zach, Mike, Ian & Will   

## Overview 
Our website presents a simple and unique character, "The Little A**hole". The poor fellow is perpetually trapped and pacing inside a yellow box, forced to hear any questions presented by front-end users. Despite his soured mood, he faithfully and petulantly supplies answers to any of your queries, pressing or frivolous. 

## API's used in our code: 

Watson Natural Language Understanding [https://cloud.ibm.com/apidocs/natural-language-understanding]
- Shapes the terms under which user input is received and the automated responses are programmed 

Yes / No [https://yesno.wtf/api]
- Provides the basis for answers to "yes or no" questions

## Git Branch Workflow
main branch 
- 
zack x Zack Hersh
Mr-Krabs'-Fuck-You-Simulator x Lolikerz

- charecter.js

<!-- Fetch API: Yes / No  -->
- scriptYoN.js

<!-- function watsonApi(question) -->

## Bugs we encountered along the way



## Fixes applied to the bugs 



Comprehension Check

## What is agile software development?



## What is an MVP? 
<!-- Minimum viable product -->
1. Front-end UI: animated character pacing in a box w/ question entry form
2. Questions are collected and assessed for type: 
3. Automated response:        



## Merge Conflicts
1. Examine the 2+ pieces of code together
2. A] If the newly pushed code is complete, then go ahead & merge it with the main branch
B] If it is incomplete, then sort through the code again, compile & format all necessary pieces, then repeat step 1 


## Learning Objectives

You will be employer-competitive if you are able to:

* Speak technically about a feature you implemented in your project
* Explain and execute git branching workflow in a collaborative project
* Resolve merge conflicts
* Explain agile software development
* Design, build, and deploy a client-side web application using GitHub Pages
* Prepare a professional presentation and repository README for your project
